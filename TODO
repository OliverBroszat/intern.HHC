General TODOs:

- Apply PEP8 to all files
- Write tests for all current modules and classes
- Add logger and config information to all classes (e.g. find an efficient way to to this)
- Add docker file to the project
- Update the README file
- Add more scripts to setup the project and perform simple tasks on it
- Think about continuous integration and the complete server architecture

Far away TODOs:

- Think about how to upgrade the system for not only HHC but different organizations (maybe one day ready to sale?)
